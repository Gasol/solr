README for solr
---------------

Solr is an enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java library.
This Debian package install Solr into the Tomcat 5.5 Java servlet 
container. After installation, point your browser to
  http://localhost:8180/solr/admin
to see the Solr web administration interface.

Homepage: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/

The following design choices have been made in packaging Solr:
- there is a solr-common package, which contains most of the code and general
  configuration, and solr-tomcat5.5 and solr-jetty packages, which provides
  configuration for Solr in Tomcat 5.5 and Jetty, respectively.
- solr-tomcat5.5 and solr-jetty use the same index files. If you remove
  solr-tomcat5.5 and install solr-jetty, you keep the indexes. This implies that
  solr-tomcat5.5 and solr-jetty cannot be installed at the same time.

Jetty is broken: you need to add the line
  $(java.lib.home)/commons-el.jar
near the end of your /etc/jetty/start.config

Replication
-----------
Solr's replication scripts are installed into /usr/share/solr/scripts
