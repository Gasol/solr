README for solr
---------------

Solr is an enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java library. The
Debian packaging of Solr consists of three binary packages:
- solr-common contains the Solr software itself and general configuration.
- solr-tomcat5.5 installs Solr as a servlet in Tomcat 5.5. After installation,
  point your browser to http://localhost:8180/solr/admin
  to see the Solr web administration interface.
- solr-jetty installs Solr as a servlet in Jetty. The Solr admin interface is at
  http://localhost:8280/solr/admin/

Solr-tomcat5.5 and solr-jetty use the same index files. If you remove solr-tomcat5.5 
and install solr-jetty, you keep the indexes. This implies that solr-tomcat5.5 and 
solr-jetty cannot be installed at the same time.

Jetty is broken: you need to add the line
  $(java.lib.home)/commons-el.jar
near the end of your /etc/jetty/start.config (see bug #352093).
