TODO.Debian for solr
--------------------

- Use minimal default configuration instead of everything from the example
- Do something with the example (package it, or supply the example files under
  /usr/share/doc/solr)
- Maybe: add solr-standalone package (using embedded Jetty like the Solr
  example). This would depend on the Jetty package, though, so maybe it's not
  such a useful idea.
