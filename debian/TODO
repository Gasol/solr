TODO.Debian for solr
--------------------

- Use minimal default configuration instead of everything from the example
- Do something with the example (package it, or supply the example files under
  /usr/share/doc/solr)
- Maybe: add solr-standalone package (using embedded Jetty like the Solr
  example). 
- Maybe: move the API docs to a separate package (it's 8.7 MB, and not generally
  useful to people just interested in running Solr, only to those extending it).
- Maybe: make seperate solrj client library package
- Do a license check also of things that 'licensecheck -r' does not catch
