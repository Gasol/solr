README for solr
---------------

Solr is an enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java library. The
Debian packaging of Solr consists of three binary packages:
- solr-common contains the Solr software itself and general configuration.
- solr-tomcat installs Solr as a servlet in Tomcat 6. After installation,
  point your browser to http://localhost:8080/solr/admin
  to see the Solr web administration interface.
- solr-jetty installs Solr as a servlet in the Jetty application server. 
  The Solr admin interface is at http://localhost:8080/solr/admin/

Homepage: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/

Configuration
-------------

The solr-common package comes with an example configuration that is not
at all suitable for production use! Please learn about solr and write
your own configuration in /etc/solr.
Certain features of the admin interface are disabled by tomcat policies.
Have a look at /etc/solr/tomcat.policy if you want to enable them.

Replication
-----------

Solr's replication scripts are installed into /usr/share/solr/scripts
Please note that there is a java based replication solution since Solr
1.4 and that we still need to find out, whether upstream will continue
to support the scripts based solution.
Also have a look at Debian Bug 538229.

Contrib
-------

Upstream provides additional functionality in so called contributions.
We have so far included only the dataimporthandler without
dataimporthandler-extras. The other contributions have dependencies not
yet packaged for Debian.

DataImportHandler
-----------------

If you use the handler with mysql, you need to install libmysql-java and
add the following to your solrconfig.xml:

  <lib path="/usr/share/java/mysql.jar" />

The handler writes status information to
/etc/solr/conf/dataimport.properties
Make sure that the tomcat user can write to this file. Yes this is ugly,
but nobody has teached the FHS to java developers yet.
